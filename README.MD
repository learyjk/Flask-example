This is my final project for CS50.  My idea was to build a WOD (Workout of the Day) Generator/Tracker that adhered to the following learning objectives:

1. Shall be developed on my local machine and deployed to the web via GitHub and Heroku.
2. Shall read/write from a remote database.
3. Shall look somewhat neat.

The web app shall:

1. Display a random workout and allow the user to click for a newly generated workout.
2. Keep track of user scores and display them chronologically.

Still to be desired:

1. Add more of the workouts (left at Murph https://www.crossfit.com/cf/faq).
2. Allow a user to add his/her own custom workout.
3. Allow user to explore WODs from a list/table rather than just get something random.
4. Allow sorting by date or by workout in /home.
5. More data validation:
  a. Minimum username/password requirements.
  b. Send an email welcoming the user upon registration.
  c. Score entry validation
